= SmallRye OpenAPI

SmallRye OpenAPI is an implementation of {microprofile-open-api}[Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI].

== Instructions

Compile and install this project:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

=== Project structure

* link:core[core] - The core OpenAPI code, independent of entry point dependencies.
* link:extension-jaxrs[extension-jaxrs] - The JAX-RS entry point. This module depends on JAX-RS and core.
* link:extension-spring[extension-spring] - The Spring entry point. This module depends on Spring and core.
* link:extension-vertx[extension-vertx] - The Vert.x entry point. This module depends on Vert.x and core.
* link:implementation[implementation] - Implementation of the Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI specification. This just pulls in Core and the JAX-RS extension .
* link:model[model] - Base model classes used by core and extensions to represent an OpenAPI document
* link:testsuite[testsuite] - Test Suites and Data
** link:testsuite/coverage[coverage] - Test coverage report aggregator for other modules
** link:testsuite/data[data] - Quarkus application with tests to verify additional annotation scanning scenarios
** link:testsuite/extra[extra] - Extra integration tests not related to the TCK.
** link:testsuite/tck[tck] - Test suite to run the implementation against the Eclipse MicroProfile OpenAPI TCK.
* link:tools[tools]
** link:tools/gradle-plugin[gradle-plugin] - Gradle plugin that creates the OpenAPI Schema on build.
** link:tools/maven-plugin[maven-plugin] - Maven plugin that creates the OpenAPI Schema on build.
** link:tools/model-apt[model-apt] - APT processor to generate model classes (in core) based on annotations (not for general-purpose use)

=== Configuration Extensions

* Property Naming Strategy
+
[source%nowrap]
----
mp.openapi.extensions.smallrye.property-naming-strategy
----
Define a naming strategy to be used globally for all schema properties. Set to one of the following:
** A standard JSON-B naming strategy (listed in `jakarta.json.bind.config.PropertyNamingStrategy`/`javax.json.bind.config.PropertyNamingStrategy`)
** A fully-qualified class name of an implementation of a JSON-B property naming strategy (`jakarta.json.bind.config.PropertyNamingStrategy` or `javax.json.bind.config.PropertyNamingStrategy`)
** A fully-qualified class name of an implementation of a Jackson property naming strategy base class (`com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.PropertyNamingStrategies.NamingBase`). Only the `translate` method is utilized.

* Removal of unused schemas
+
[source%nowrap]
----
mp.openapi.extensions.smallrye.remove-unused-schemas.enable
----
Set to `true` enable automatic removal of unused schemas from `components/schemas` in the OpenAPI model. Unused schemas will be removed following annotation scanning but prior to running any `OASFilter` that may be configured. Default value is `false`.

* Automatic Schema Inheritance
+
[source%nowrap]
----
mp.openapi.extensions.smallrye.auto-inheritance
----
Configures handling of schema inheritance. Allowed values include `NONE` (default), `BOTH`, and `PARENT_ONLY`.
** `NONE` disables automatic schema inheritance. Parent class properties will be includes in the properties map of each child class unless `@Schema(allOf = { ... })` has been specified on the child class.
** `BOTH` enables automatic schema inheritance by placing both the child and parent class within the child schema's `allOf` property _unless_ `@Schema(allOf = { ... })`  has already been specified on the child class. `BOTH` processing can be selectively disabled on individual classes by setting `@Schema(allOf = void.class)` on the child class and no `allOf` will be set on the resulting schema - parent and child properties will be present in the child schema as if `NONE` were used.
** `PARENT_ONLY` enables automatic schema inheritance by placing only the parent class within the child schema's `allOf` property _unless_ `@Schema(allOf = { ... })`  has already been specified on the child class. `PARENT_ONLY` processing can be selectively disabled on individual classes by setting `@Schema(allOf = void.class)` on the child class and no `allOf` will be set on the resulting schema - parent and child properties will be present in the child schema as if `NONE` were used.

* Duplicate Operation ID Behavior
+
[source%nowrap]
----
mp.openapi.extensions.smallrye.duplicateOperationIdBehavior
----
Set to `FAIL` to abort in case of duplicate operationIds, set to `WARN` to log warnings when the build encounters duplicate operationIds. Default value is `WARN`.

* Maximum Static File Size
+
[source%nowrap]
----
mp.openapi.extensions.smallrye.maximumStaticFileSize
----
Set this value in order to change the maximum threshold for processed static files, when generating model from them. If not set, it will default to 3 MB.

* Merge Schema Examples
+
[source%nowrap]
----
mp.openapi.extensions.smallrye.merge-schema-examples
----
Set this boolean value to disable the merging of the deprecated `@Schema` `example` property into the `examples` array introduced in OAS 3.1.0. If not set, it will default to `true` the deprecated `example` will be mapped to the `examples` array in the OpenAPI model.
